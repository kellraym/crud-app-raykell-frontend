# To Do List 2.0 (aka Two Do List)
  I kept it simple with this one. It similar to the to-do apps from earlier in the course, but with a few upgrades. It contains all the required attributes, including 
  -React front end
  -express back end with get, post, put, patch, and delete routes
  -Postgres database (through heroku deployed backend app)
  -CSS Styling to make it look less ugly
  -All deployed on Heroku at 
    https://crud-app-raykell-frontend.herokuapp.com/
    &&
    https://crud-app-raykell-backend.herokuapp.com/

## Navbar
Every page has access to a persistent navbar with links to the home page, add item page, and completed items page as well as a search bar where to-do items can be searched by name. All pages are linked through react-router-dom and the entire app functions as a single page application.
